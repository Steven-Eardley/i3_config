# i3 config

Most lines I've added or configured are in sections denoted by:

	# -------
	blah settings

i3 is awesome. Well, it's not [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/), but it's even better.

## Some instructions:

* It is optimised for an Apple Wireless Keyboard (uses eject key on kbd for shutdown)

* Create a symbolic link from i3status.conf, hidden in home folder:
		ln -s ~/.i3/i3status.conf ~/.i3status.conf

* Place i3exit in ~/bin/ and ensure it is executable.
